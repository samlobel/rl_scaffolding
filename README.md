# RL Scaffolding
When starting a new project, I'll clone this repository as a starting place. It should make experimentation with the type of logging I prefer easier.


#### Example that works:

`python experiments/experiment1.py --hyper_parameter_name 00 --experiment_name ./results/testing --run_title testing --learning_rate 100.0`
